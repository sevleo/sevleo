# Hola ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sev and I'm a Full Stack Engineer! I've been working in the IT field on technical and semi-techncal roles since 2015, but in the beginnning of 2023 I developed a taste and passion for development. I began my coding journey with Python, now I'm learning JavaScript and web development.
